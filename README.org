#+TITLE: Edible Campus UNC App/Server/Admin-Portal Repository

This is where the work for the front-end, back-end, and admin front-end live. The original repository is at https://www.github.com/morganjng/edible-campus-unc, but I expect that this may be forked by whoever either takes this over, or by myself if I continue to work on this. If you have questions about this work (or you happen to be in charge of continuing our work in the next semester), feel free to email or text me; my email is *_morganjng@gmail.com_* and my phone number is *(704) 307-7189.*

* Project layout
** app/
This is the directory of the user-facing front-end for the Edible Campus UNC app. This is being developed in Flutter, and all code that is of concern is in the *lib/* subdirectory --- the rest is auto-generated by Flutter.
** admin/
This is an implementation of the admin portal done in React. It does not have as many features as the Flutter one, but depending on where/how you are hosting this, it may be a better fit.
** portal/
This is the Flutter implementation of the admin portal. Again, all of our code is in *lib/*, but the built website from this is in *build/web/*.
** server/
This is the back-end/server/webpage for the admin portal. This is designed for Carolina Cloud Apps, which uses Kubernetes, and this hosts the generated website from the *portal/* directory. It also serves and handles json data for users and admins alike. This was done in Node with Express.

* Code documentation
Code documentation can be found in the source code files (hopefully we have commented it up to whoever it may concern's standards), as well as in the READMEs of each child directory. Comments are largely omitted from locations where the code is self-explanatory.

* Dependencies
Dependencies are likewise discussed further in their own directories, but this project is fairly dependency-light, and there shouldn't be too much to be wary of.

* Deployment
Unfornately due to time restrains, we were unable to deploy the projects to Carolina Cloud Apps. For instructions on how to run the app locally, please refer to our tutorial video listed on our project website.
